Whenever a function is called from another function the control jumps from the calling function to the called function and 
then after executive again returns to the caller.

If any function is called several times then it may cause delay in program execution,.

An inline function is a function which is expanded or put in the same place from where it is called, this is done before 
the execution of program starts and it increases speed of program execution by eliminating frequent jumps from caller to callie 
and vice versa.

#include <iostream>
 
using namespace std;

inline int Max(int x, int y) {
   return (x > y)? x : y;
}

// Main function for the program
int main() {
   cout << "Max (20,10): " << Max(20,10) << endl;
   cout << "Max (0,200): " << Max(0,200) << endl;
   cout << "Max (100,1010): " << Max(100,1010) << endl;
   
   return 0;
}
