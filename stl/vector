Iterators:
begin() 
end() 
cbegin()
cend()
rbegin()
rend()
crbegin()
crend()


// C++ program to illustrate the 
// iterators in vector 
#include <iostream> 
#include <vector> 

using namespace std; 

int main() 
{ 
	vector<int> g1; 

	for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) 
		g1.push_back(i); 

	cout << "Output of begin and end: "; 
	for (auto i = g1.begin(); i != g1.end(); ++i) 
		cout << *i << " "; 

	cout << "\nOutput of cbegin and cend: "; 
	for (auto i = g1.cbegin(); i != g1.cend(); ++i) 
		cout << *i << " "; 

	cout << "\nOutput of rbegin and rend: "; 
	for (auto ir = g1.rbegin(); ir != g1.rend(); ++ir) 
		cout << *ir << " "; 

	cout << "\nOutput of crbegin and crend : "; 
	for (auto ir = g1.crbegin(); ir != g1.crend(); ++ir) 
		cout << *ir << " ";

Capacity:


    size() 
    max_size() 
    capacity() 
    resize(n) – Resizes the container so that it contains ‘n’ elements.
    empty() 
    shrink_to_fit() 
    reserve() 
    
    
    
    
 Eleement access:
 
  front() – Returns a reference to the first element in the vector
back() – Returns a reference to the last element in the vector
data() – Returns a direct pointer to the memory array used internally by the vector to store its owned elements.






Modifiers:

assign(old,new) – It assigns new value to the vector elements by replacing old ones
push_back() – It push the elements into a vector from the back
pop_back() – It is used to pop or remove elements from a vector from the back.
insert(position,element) – It inserts new elements before the element at the specified position
erase() – It is used to remove elements from a container from the specified position or range.
swap() – It is used to swap the contents of one vector with another vector of same type. Sizes may differ.
clear() – It is used to remove all the elements of the vector container
emplace() – It extends the container by inserting new element at position
emplace_back() – It is used to insert a new element into the vector container, the new element is added to the end of the vector
