Explanation :The class A has just one data member a which is public. 
This class is virtually inherited in class B and class C. 
Now class B and class C becomes virtual base class and no duplication of data member a is done.





#include <iostream> 
using namespace std; 

class A { 
public: 
	int a; 
	A() // constructor 
	{ 
		a = 10; 
	} 
}; 

class B : public virtual A { 
}; 

class C : public virtual A { 
}; 

class D : public B, public C { 
}; 

int main() 
{ 
	D object; // object creation of class d 
	cout << "a = " << object.a << endl; 

	return 0; 
}
